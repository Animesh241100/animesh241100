### Hi ðŸ‘‹
### I'm Animesh

This is Animesh Kumar, a Computer Science and Engineering student from IIITDM Kancheepuram, Chennai. I love creating web applications and understand the underlying wiring of how the web request-response cycles work. In this exploration I ended up learning full stack web development using Reactjs. In web and in computer scinece in general, I like the backend and knowing the details of these inner workings more. I like working on linux and understanding how the processes get created, scheduled and synchronised using multithreading. I am also very interested in theoretical side of computer science e.g. `Theory of Computation` and `Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms`. I am still in the process of exploration.
