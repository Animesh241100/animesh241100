### Hi ðŸ‘‹
### I'm Animesh

This is Animesh Kumar, a Computer Science and Engineering student from IIITDM Kancheepuram, Chennai. I love creating web applications and understand the underlying wiring of how the web request-response cycles work. In this exploration I ended up learning full stack web development. In web and in computer scinece in general, I like the backend and knowing the details of these inner workings more. I like working on linux and understanding how the processes get created, scheduled and how the threads are synchronised. I am also very interested in theoretical side of computer science e.g. `Theory of Computation` and `Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms`. I am still in the process of exploration ðŸ˜‰

### What I am working on?
I have been working on the [blog-project]("https://github.com/Animesh241100/blog-project") from long. [visit darkviolet]("http://darkviolet.pythonanywhere.com/"). Although it is deployed now, but I am gonna add more features to it. ðŸ’»

### What I am learning now?
I am currently learning how to use ML models to solve the real world problems. Calculus and maths in general ðŸ“– have always intrigued me. I have learnt `sklearn` and learning how to choose which ML algorithm.
