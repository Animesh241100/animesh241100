## Hi 👋
### I'm Animesh

## Brief Introduction
A Computer Science and Engineering student from IIITDM Kancheepuram, Chennai. I love creating web applications and understand the underlying wiring of how the web request-response cycles work. In this exploration I ended up learning full stack web development. In web and in computer scinece in general, I like the backend and knowing the details of these inner workings more. I like working on linux and understanding how the processes get created, scheduled and how the threads are synchronised. I am also very interested in theoretical side of computer science e.g. `Theory of Computation` and `Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms`. I am still in the process of exploration 😉


### Skills:

### What I am working on? 
I have been working on the [blog-project](https://github.com/Animesh241100/blog-project), a single page webapp from long. [visit darkviolet](http://darkviolet.pythonanywhere.com/). Although it is deployed now, but I am gonna add more features to it. 💻

### What I am learning now? 🤔
I am currently learning how to use ML models to solve the real world problems. Calculus and maths in general 📖 have always intrigued me. I have learnt `sklearn` and learning how to choose which ML algorithm.
